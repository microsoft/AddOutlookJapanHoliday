# VBScript adding Japan new Holidays to Outlook

[日本語版 README はこちら](https://github.com/Microsoft/AddOutlookJapanHoliday/tree/master/ja-jp)

Starting from 2019, there are some additions/changes to Public Holidays in Japan.  

However, no updates have been released for the extended support phase products and Outlook for some update channels.  
We made a script 'AddHolidays.vbs' to add new holidays, so please consider using it.

This script will add holidays in 2021~ to your Outlook default calendar. This script will add only new holidays that does not exist in the calendar. So you can run this script whenever holidays already exist or not.

## How to use

1. Download [AddHolidays.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/AddOutlookJapanHoliday/releases) and extract it. If you are using Outlook in English and the names of holidays are English, download AddHolidays_en.zip.
2. Double-click on 'AddHolidays.vbs' (or 'AddHolidays_en.vbs') on a machine running Outlook.
3. Open Outlook and confirm holidays are successfully updated.
